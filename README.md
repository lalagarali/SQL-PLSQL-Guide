**Data** is raw facts or figures.

**Information** is processed data that is meaningful.

**Knowledge** is understanding gained from information.

**What is dataset?** A dataset is a collection of related data organized in a structured format, often in rows and columns, like a table.

**What is Big Data?** Big data is a term used to describe extremely large datasets that are difficult to store, process, and analyze using traditional methods due to their size, speed, and variety.

**What is Database?**

**Database**: Stores structured data for daily transactions and operations.

**Data Lake**: A large, raw data storage system that holds unstructured and structured data.

**Data Mart**: A smaller, focused version of a data warehouse, tailored to specific business needs.

**Data Warehouse**: A central repository for integrated, structured data designed for analysis and reporting.

**What is SQL?** SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language used for managing and manipulating databases.

**What is PL/SQL?** PL/SQL (Procedural Language/SQL) is an extension of SQL used for writing complex queries and procedures, adding procedural logic to SQL.

| XMLTYPE       | Stores XML data.                                     |
| ANYTYPE       | Generic data type for any type of data.              |
| ANYDATA       | Stores any type of data dynamically.                 |

SQL Table Creation with All Oracle Data Types:

```sql
CREATE TABLE all_oracle_data_types (
    customer_name VARCHAR2(50),  -- Customer's full name
    gender CHAR(1),  -- Gender ('M' for Male, 'F' for Female)
    customer_id NUMBER,  -- Unique customer identifier
    age INTEGER,  -- Age of the customer
    balance FLOAT,  -- Account balance
    annual_salary DOUBLE PRECISION,  -- Annual salary
    join_date DATE,  -- Date when the customer joined
    last_purchase TIMESTAMP,  -- Last purchase timestamp
    time_difference INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND,  -- Time interval example
    bio CLOB,  -- Large text data (e.g., biography)
    profile_picture BLOB,  -- Binary data (e.g., profile picture)
    transaction_id RAW(16),  -- Unique transaction ID
    description LONG,  -- Long text description (deprecated, but still supported)
    country_code NCHAR(5),  -- Country code (Unicode)
    preferred_language NVARCHAR2(20),  -- Preferred language (Unicode)
    customer_data XMLTYPE,  -- XML formatted customer data
    is_active BOOLEAN,  -- Boolean value indicating active status (PL/SQL only)
    height BINARY_FLOAT,  -- Floating-point value (32-bit)
    weight BINARY_DOUBLE,  -- Floating-point value (64-bit)
    row_id UROWID  -- Universal row ID
);
```

**Data Type Comparison Rules**

| **Implicit Conversion**     | **Explicit Conversion**                               |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Automatic type conversion performed by Oracle.      | Manual type conversion explicitly defined by the user. |
| Performed automatically by Oracle when necessary.    | Triggered by the user using conversion functions.     |
| Example: `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary = '1000';` | Example: `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary = TO_NUMBER('1000');` |
| No explicit functions needed.                        | Functions like `TO_NUMBER()`, `TO_DATE()`, `TO_CHAR()` are used. |
| No user intervention required.                       | User must explicitly specify the conversion.         |
| Occurs when Oracle detects a need for type compatibility. | Occurs when the user explicitly defines the conversion logic. |



**Literals**

â€¢ Text Literals

| **Prefix / Notation** | **SQL Name** | **Description** | **Example** | **Result** |
|-----------------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|------------|
| **'...'**             | Character String Literal | Used to create a simple text literal. | `SELECT 'Loan approved' FROM dual;` | `Loan approved` |
| **N'...'**            | National Character Literal | Used to store Unicode text. | `SELECT N'Lale Qarali' FROM dual;` | `Lale Qarali` |
| **q'...'**            | Alternative Quoting Mechanism | Allows using `'` and `"` inside string literals easily. | `SELECT q'[Customer's name: 'Lale Qarali']' FROM dual;` | `Customer's name: 'Lale Qarali'` |
| **Q'...'**            | Alternative Quoting Mechanism (Uppercase version) | Same as `q'...'`, alternative notation. | `SELECT Q'{Slogan: "Your trust is our value"}' FROM dual;` | `Slogan: "Your trust is our value"` |
| **c'...'**            | Character Literal Prefix | Used to define character-type literals. | `SELECT c'Mastercard' AS Card_Type FROM dual;` | `Mastercard` |

â€¢ Numeric Literals
â€¢ Datetime Literals
â€¢ Interval Literals 

â€¢ Format Models

A format model is a character literal that describes the format of datetime or numeric data stored in a character string.
