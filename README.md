**Data** is raw facts or figures.

**Information** is processed data that is meaningful.

**Knowledge** is understanding gained from information.

**What is dataset?** A dataset is a collection of related data organized in a structured format, often in rows and columns, like a table.

**What is Big Data?** Big data is a term used to describe extremely large datasets that are difficult to store, process, and analyze using traditional methods due to their size, speed, and variety.

**What is Database?**

**Database**: Stores structured data for daily transactions and operations.

**Data Lake**: A large, raw data storage system that holds unstructured and structured data.

**Data Mart**: A smaller, focused version of a data warehouse, tailored to specific business needs.

**Data Warehouse**: A central repository for integrated, structured data designed for analysis and reporting.

| ANYDATA       | Stores any type of data dynamically.                 |

SQL Table Creation with All Oracle Data Types

The following SQL script creates a table named all_oracle_data_types that includes various Oracle SQL data types, with realistic column names and example values.

```sql
CREATE TABLE all_oracle_data_types (
    customer_name VARCHAR2(50),  -- Customer's full name
    gender CHAR(1),  -- Gender ('M' for Male, 'F' for Female)
    customer_id NUMBER,  -- Unique customer identifier
    age INTEGER,  -- Age of the customer
    balance FLOAT,  -- Account balance
    annual_salary DOUBLE PRECISION,  -- Annual salary
    join_date DATE,  -- Date when the customer joined
    last_purchase TIMESTAMP,  -- Last purchase timestamp
    time_difference INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND,  -- Time interval example
    bio CLOB,  -- Large text data (e.g., biography)
    profile_picture BLOB,  -- Binary data (e.g., profile picture)
    transaction_id RAW(16),  -- Unique transaction ID
    description LONG,  -- Long text description (deprecated, but still supported)
    country_code NCHAR(5),  -- Country code (Unicode)
    preferred_language NVARCHAR2(20),  -- Preferred language (Unicode)
    customer_data XMLTYPE,  -- XML formatted customer data
    is_active BOOLEAN,  -- Boolean value indicating active status (PL/SQL only)
    height BINARY_FLOAT,  -- Floating-point value (32-bit)
    weight BINARY_DOUBLE,  -- Floating-point value (64-bit)
    row_id UROWID  -- Universal row ID
);
